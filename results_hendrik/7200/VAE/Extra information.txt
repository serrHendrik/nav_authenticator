***Data***
Data period: 10-09-2019
Delay: 7200s

Training set: All other satellites
Validation set (to determine threshold): E04
Test set 1 (to check if threshold holds): E01
Test set 2 (to inject errors): E03


***Model*** 
Variational Autoencoder


***Errors***
Type2: Scaling base variables (sp, sv, svCb) with a given fraction
Type4: Starting from timestep 200, we keep the velocity constant and push the satellite position (sp) in the direction of the velocity (multiplied with a constant to speed up the process)
Type6: Starting from timestep 200, we let the clock bias drift linearly with a given constant
